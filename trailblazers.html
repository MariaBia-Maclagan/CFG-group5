                <p class="columnText">Ada's mathematical talent shone through in her early life, and her skills and interest in machines lead to a working relationship with Charles Babbage. Babbage was the inventor of the ‚ÄúAnalytical Engine‚Äù, a complicated device that was never actually created, but resembled the elements of a modern computer.<br />
                  As a result of her work on the project, Ada is often referred to as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs first computer programmer‚Äù. It was Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine that Alan Turing used as a form of inspiration for his work on the first modern computer in the 1940s.
                  The early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day (globalapptesting.com, 2021).</p>
